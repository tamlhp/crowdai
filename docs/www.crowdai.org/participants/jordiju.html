        <p><p>Hi all</p>

<p>We have received several questions from interested participants that would like to have a look at the code for the most successful solutions.</p>

<p>Even though we have received access to the code of the leading submitters, we would not want to blindly redistribute it. Instead, if you are one of the leading submitters (say inside the top 10, these approaches all look very promising to me), you might consider publishing your code on a public repo, as user @twonests has done above.</p>

<p>As this would be outside the challenge, you may of course pick a licence of your choice for this repo (or none at all, in which case you retain exclusive copyright).</p>

<p>Apart from participants of this challenge, this might very well arouse interest from other parties as well. For example, we have contact with a couple of research groups at universities that I imagine would be very interested to learn about the many new ideas that have been explored by you guys.</p>

<p>If you decide to proceed, it would be great if you could post the link to your repo also in this thread.</p>

  <p>I used python to decompose the global problem into a routing and a scheduling problems, each formulated as MIP and solved by Gurobi. For the routing problem, the main idea was to balance the number of occupations on each resource, so as to avoid congestion on the most used ones. The scheduling part was quite straightforward, with some care to reduce at most the number of disjunctive constraints expressing the order of trains on sections / ressources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very interesting, thanks! We also use MILP internally and have always been thinking about decomposing routing and scheduling, but never implemented it. It has drawbacks of course, but fore some instances it’s probably the only way to prevent explosion of the MILP model. Would love to have a look how you choose the routes.</p>

        <p><p>Hi all</p>

<p>Murphy visited the SBB validator yesterday evening around 21:00 UTC and made sure it would no longer grade any submissions for the remainder of the challenge.</p>

<p>This prevented <a href="sign_in.html">4 submissions</a> from being graded that were submitted before the deadline.</p>

<p>The good news is that the submission files were saved by crowdAI, so we can grade them next week once the validator is running again.</p>

<p>The bad news is that this <em>may</em> lead to “post-mortem” changes on the leaderboard which might cause some confusion.</p>

<p>We already preventively ask for your understanding if you should be affected by such a change.</p>

<p>Thanks!
Julian</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say that ;) If your solution is, as you mentioned, still reasonably generic, it might be a very interesting heuristic solver to add to our solver pool.</p>

<p>Thanks @Palstek ! Yes, in hindsight this is probably our biggest regret as well. The initial rationale was to leave as much freedom for technologies, languages, etc. as possible. But the tradeoff in the end is probably not worth the gain because, as you say, most people would still choose common tools. Also there were timeline restrictions that “encouraged” us to go for the easier setup we chose.</p>

<p>Next time we would surely let the algorithms run against an unknown test set.</p>

<p>From the admin team, thanks so much for participating in this challenge! We are thrilled with the results, so for us, it has already been a huge success.</p>

<p>At the same time, we know not everything was perfect and it was a hard problem to even get started with. To help us improve and make the next SBB challenges (and there <em>will</em> be more) more accessible, fairer, better, we welcome your feedback on this current challenge.</p>

<p>Feel free to share with us anything you feel could have been done better. We will do our best to incorporate these learnings in future challenges.</p>

<p>Of course, positive feedback is also welcome.</p>

<p>In the name of everybody involved organizing this challenge, THANKS AGAIN!</p>

        Procedure after Challenge ends |&nbsp; 12 months ago
      </p>
      <div class='comment' id='comment_1326'
        <p><p>Hi guys</p>

<p>Quick info on how we plan to proceed after the challenge ends, so you know what to expect.</p>

<p>A crowdAI representative will contact you with information how you can set up a private Repository on the crowdAI Gitlab, to which you can upload your code and a short documentation (including installation and usage instructions). For those participants that qualify for awards, remember that we require that the code be released under the MIT licence in order to get the award. For all other participants, we still encourage you to make your code public, so the community can benefit. Remember also, that we can award up to five travel grants to the <a href="https://www.appliedmldays.org/">Applied Machine Learning Days</a> in January. So if you give us a chance to look at your code, even if you don’t qualify for monetary awards, we may still want to invite you to the ML days and meet you in person.</p>

<p>We will then spend some time to review the code.</p>

<p>For the participants eligible for awards, we would then like to have a short Skype call with each of them. Dont’ worry, this is not an exam! It’s just that we want to give you a chance to talk about your ideas and algorithms, and also gather some feedback about the challenge itself. During the call, we would also ask participants to solve some of the instances “live”. So they should be prepared to do that.</p>

<p>If you have any more questions, fire away.
Cheers
Julian</p>

        <p><p>Hi @Raluca</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="../topics/solver-time/discussion.html">other discussion</a>, the best way is to submit the best solution you have been able to obtain in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>We will ask participants to show us the solver “live” before deploying it ourselves. So we would expect that participants are able to reproduce the solutions they submitted.</p>

<p>Also, there is probably no guarantee that 32 cores will be at all faster than, say, 4 or 8 cores. Depending on seeds and other random effects, it could be even slower. Other people have mentioned that the results from a 32-core AWS-machine was actually worse than from the local laptop.</p>

<p>Last but not least, our cloud provider does not specify what kind of physical CPU they are actually using. We can configure a pod with “32’000 millicores”, but we don’t know what is actually behind this.</p>

<p>Meaning: Don’t rely on us to be able to run your algorithms faster than you.</p>

      <div class='comment' id='comment_1318'
        <p><p>Hi all</p>

<p>Several people have asked when the <em>exact</em> deadline for the challenge is, or have otherwise hinted that they intend to submit their best solutions just before the challenge ends.</p>

<p>Please be advised that our validator service, which checks validity of the solutions and computes their score, is not built to handle a huge load of submissions. If ten participants submit concurrently, it may be enough to crash the service.</p>

<p>And we will not be around at midnight to fix it ;)</p>

<p>We suggest making your final submissions at least 12 hours before the deadline to be sure it’s on the board.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and, <em>Keep rocking!</em></p>

Its presolve might or might not help with the solution but generally LP relaxation is solved by cplex/gurobi. If you don’t have an AMPL license, we can produce the file that AMPL passes to the solver (with .nl extension) and you should be able to run it using the solver standalone. Does this work for you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Works. Please make sure to count the time for the AMPL modelling and presolve into the 15min timeout.</p>

<p>I assume you are referring to <a href="https://ampl.com/products/standard-price-list/">this</a>. In combination with CPLEX (or Gurobi) this should be fine, yes. I assume you use AMPL to produce the LP-file that is then solved by CPLEX. It would be helpful if you could produce these LP-file separately, if asked to do so, because we don’t use AMPL.</p>

  <p>so does that mean if a train has 3 different resources, it also means that this train is on a physical track that is shared by other 3 different service intentions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hi @zb. Not sure if I understand the question correctly. Typically, our “resources” correspond to the physical section between two signals. Since a train running at full speed needs a whole ‘wave’ of green signals in front of him, it is normal that a train “occupies” all these resources. That is why it usually occupies multiple resources on a route_section.</p>

<p>If a different train uses the same resources, then yes, that typically means it runs on the same physical track(s).</p>

  <p>Thanks. I am not sure it was clearly answered in that discussion because it says “you are allowed and encouraged to make it open also to the public” but it is not clear whether to be eligible for prizes you must make it open source. Thus, it sounds more like “A) only to the organizers”. In other words, the code should be given to the organizers under MIT so they can use it but the code will not be available to other participants and public in general, unless, the winner desires so. Therefore, I think that “a participant must release their solution unter the MIT License . We encourage all participants to open-source their code!” is a bit misleading and should clearly state either “must release their solution under the MIT License to the organizers” or “must release their solution under the MIT License and make it publicly available”. Note that the text “We encourage all participants to open-source their code!” does not clarify this because it says “all participants”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks, I see your point. To be eligible for prizes, you must release your code under the MIT licence and make it code available to the organizers. You are not required to make it available to the general public.</p>

<p>Note that the licencse states “Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to <em>any person</em> obtaining a copy of this software…” It would therefore follow that one cannot release a piece of software under MIT <em>to one specific party</em>. It is either released under MIT (and then everybody who gets their hands on it is free to use it), or it is not.</p>

<p>We can agree that the proper formulation in the Challenge rule should be “In order to be eligible for prizes, a participant must release their solution unter the MIT License and make it available to the organizers”.</p>

<p>I will clarify this part in the rules. OK?</p>

        <p><p>@LeoB, @hur That is certainly an option, yes. We generally do not use AWS internally but our “own” cloud provider. It may be that our instances are slower than an AWS r4.8xlarge (we honestly don’t even know what kind of CPU we have under our machines). However, if you can show that it works with an AWS r4.8xlarge, we would certainly accept that.</p>

<p>And, again, if the results are actually worse than from your local notebook - just use the local solution. Don’t extrapolate, hoping we would miraculously be able to find hardware that brings computation time down to 15 minutes.</p>

        <p><p>@hur Yes, we realize the situation is not perfect. Still, I strongly urge anyone to only submit what they have been able to run themselves (locally or on some VM/Pod) within 15min/instance under the given hardware-restrictions. If your results on the large VM were worse than on your local laptop, just use the best solution you have been able to obtain locally. It is unlikely we have better hardware than you, so there is no reason to believe that our VMs would be more powerful than the one you tried.</p>

<p>Generally, the strength of the algorithm is more important than raw computing power. So don’t feel too bad if you run your algorithm on 4 or 8 cores only. In many cases - as you also experienced - the performance is even better with less cores.</p>

        <p><p>Hi @Raluca there isn’t really, no. We cannot prevent participants to upload submissions which took longer than 15mins for some of the intances.</p>

<p>Of course, before awarding any prizes, we will verify the time limits were observed by actually running the solvers. So there really isn’t much point for people to submit solutions which would be disqualified later and it would also cause unnecessary work for everybody involved.</p>

<p>We appeal to people’s common sense and fair play to not upload submissions which took longer to produce than the allotted time limit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Hi @Roman Chernenko. The errors you receive should in fact only be warnings, because they are a violation of business rule #101, which says delays are allowed. Somebody already reported this problem (that the validator says “error” when it should only be a warning) a while ago, though I can’t find the thread anymore. It was resolved by modifying the ‘parameters’ in all problem instances. If you pull the latest version of the problem instance files, and then validate again, you should no longer receive errors.</p>

<p>The reason the submission is successfully graded is that when you make a submission, the grader actually has a copy of the problem instance files (which of course we updated to have the new parameters). So there you get the correct result.</p>

<p>TL;DR: just update the problem instance files and you should receive the same result as from the grader.</p>

<p>The example provided by @ms123 pointed us in the right direction. Indeed there is another bug in the way the routing penalty is calculated. A fix will be deployed on Monday.
This does not affect the validity of solutions. Any solution that is considered valid by the current validator will remain valid. The only difference will be a possible increase in the routing penalty.</p>

        <p><p>Hi all</p>

<p>We have added a simple script that basically joins the route_section information from the problem instance to the solution. This way you can easily see which route_sections resulted in how much routing penalty.</p>

<p>You find the script here: <a href="https://github.com/crowdAI/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge-starter-kit/blob/master/utils/route_penalty.py">https://github.com/crowdAI/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge-starter-kit/blob/master/utils/route_penalty.py</a></p>

<p>It’s quick and dirty and not executable, you have to run it in a REPL or an IDE or copy-paste into a notebook. (If somebody wants to make it executable, pull requests welcome ;) ).</p>

  <p>Can you give an indication, what the problem in the validator was? E.g., was it some “systematic” error in reading the data or so? Because since your update this afternoon, solutions which were valid in the previous validator now are infeasible for me due to resource conflicts, so I probably miss the same thing that was wrong in your previous validator in the moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a bug in how it was decided whether any two train_run_sections should be compared to each other to see if they cause resource occupation conflicts. Remember, for example, that two train_run_sections from the same service intention <em>are</em> allowed to use a resource without respecting the release_time of the resource. Therefore, the validator does not check a pair of train_run_sections from the same service intention. Basically what happened is that it also did not check certain pairs of train_run_sections from <em>distinct</em> trains. If this pair happened to cause a resource occupation conflict, we did not detect that. So in this sense, it was a systematic problem, although the effect was indeed a little random.</p>

<p>The effect that certain solutions that were previously valid are now rejected is expected. This is why we will also re-evaluate all leading submission on the leaderboard. The detailed validation feedback should tell you precisely which trains on which sections cause the conflict on what resource. I guess your first step would be to take a few examples of the feedback and confirm whether the solution really violates the rules and then try to determine how that could happen in your solver/model.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it has been pointed out that the validator still does not catch all errors. Specifically, it can happen that it does not detect a resource occupation conflict in a solution.</p>

<p>A fix is in the works, but can unfortunately not be deployed over the weekend.</p>

<p>After the fix is deployed, we will manually re-check all submissions appearing on the leaderboard to make sure they still comply with all rules.</p>

<p>Until the fix is deployed,</p>

<ul>
  <li>please do not upload any submissions via the challenge page</li>
  <li>you may keep using the validation scripts / notebooks. However, be advised that the validator may miss resource occupation conflicts in certain cases. Currently, a validation feedback with zero errors is no guarantee that the solution indeed complies with all business rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. We will keep you updated.</p>

      <div class='comment' id='comment_1238'
        <p><p>The total penalty is the sum of delay and route penalties. My first guess would be that the difference can be attributed to route penalties.</p>

<p>Unfortuntaley the grader does not print out the details and since routing penalties do not produce warnings, it’s a bit hard to follow what exactly the grader does. We will improve it so it prints out the components of the total penalty.</p>

<p>In the meantime: the validation_result object has an attribute ‘detail’ which contains the individual penalties making up the total. Could you check what they contain? If they don’t sum up to 47.183, we would indeed have a problem.</p>

<p>Example: notice the ‘minutes_of_dealy’ and ‘route_penalty’ fields. The ‘objective_value’ must be the sum of those two.

<p>Based on the valid points raised by @LeoB and @Palstek in the thread <a href="../topics/questions-about-the-competition-rules/discussion.html">Questions about the Competition Rules</a>, we have added the following condition to the <a href="../organizers/sbb-cff-ffs/challenges/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge.html">challenge rules</a>.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for prizes
* The solver must generic enough that it is able to handle problem instances that are similar to the nine <a href="https://github.com/crowdAI/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge-starter-kit/tree/master/problem_instances">published problem instances</a>. Custom tuning of the solver to the nine published instances is allowed, but must be within reasonable limits. For example, (hyper)parameter-tuning of an algorithm based on the nine instances is ok. Reading in solutions, or partial solutions, to the problem instances as part of the “algorithm” is not ok.</p>

        <p><p>Thing is, if one knows the objective value for the best solution, this information can be used to reduce the search space and (possible greatly) speed up the algorithm.</p>

<p>But in real life you don’t know in advance if there exists a feasible schedule, or how much penalty the best penalty will have. So I would actually prefer to stay tight-lipped about what the best penalties are.</p>

<p>If you are asking because you are wondering if your solutions will really be accepted, what I <em>can</em> say is that you may trust the validator. I know, I know, every once in a while we have a problem with it, such as it not recognizing violated connections, but it should be all good now and if you do not receive any ERRORS, then yes, your solution is valid.</p>

<p>Does this answer alleviate your concerns?</p>

        <p><p>@elTuki : Ah, yes, that was indeed the problem traintraintrain reported. We updated the problem instances to allow a max delay of up to 24 hours. Did you pull the repository recently?</p>

<p>Try a pull to get the latest updates and then check the files. You should find the following lines:</p>

<p>“parameters”: {
		“maxBandabweichung”: “PT24H”
	}</p>

<p>probably now it say ‘PT5M’ instead of PT24H.</p>

        <p><p>Just to add, because this is quite a good question:</p>

<p>If someone tries to be funny and runs a solver for, say, a week, then saves the best solutions, then builds another “solver” that basically just reconstructs these solutions, we would - as you might imagine - not award this.</p>

<p>The rules say “your solutions must be produced from the problem instances by your code”. Taken literally, one might argue that a “solver” as described above does not violate this rule.</p>

<p>But, as mentioned, we use common sense when juding the code, and I think everybody would agree that such a solver should not be awarded.</p>

<p>Generally, we would expect that the solvers also work for similar instances that we have not published. This should be a good rule of thumb to decide how far you can go with tuning it for the published instances.</p>

        <p><p>Hi @elTuki .</p>

<p>“Behind the scenes” the business rule 101 is actually implemented with a hard constraint that the delay must not be more than 24 hours for any of the trains. I figured that would be enough delay for everybody. Also, we don’t really handle the case when a train crosses midnight - our data model only handles a time-of-day, not a datetime. For this reason we kind of have to insist that all trains can be delayed, but not so much that they are not scheduled on the same day anymore.</p>

<p>If you still get validation errors, my guess is that at least one train is delayed more than 24 hours. Is this possible?</p>

<p>and</p>

  <p>I see these same problems too. In principle you can just use a terribly overfitted ML-Algorithm that will output solutions that were used during training but would not be computable in 15min with the programmed algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We realize that. We conciously allow this practice, yes. The reason is that such “overfitting” might actually be a good strategy also in the realy word - for example in a fixed region of Switzerland. So we’re interested to find interesting ideas in this area.</p>

<p>Sure, if you just train which CPLEX-parameters are optimal for a particular instance, we probably don’t learn much. But we don’t forbid it.</p>

        <p><p>Hi guys. Several answers in sequence of your remarks</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However given the wall-clock time limit it might be realy hard to make the result reproducable if you give the solver a timelimit after which he needs to stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, at the end of the day we will need to use common sense when we evaluate people’s code. Many solvers are actually surprisingly deterministic, so reproducing the results is rather easy. If someone’s solution is more random, that is ok. However, we will certainly check that we are able to reliably reproduce the solutions a participant submitted in the best submission. By ‘reliably’ I mean that if we run the code 5 times and get to (or very close to) the best submission of the particpant 4 times, then what would be considered reliable. If it only gets there 50’% of the time, then…not so much.</p>

        <p><p>Hi guys</p>

<p>Indeed connection errors were not detected. The problem was that the solution validator got updated by mistake, and since we started the challenge the data format has changed. It therefore did not check for “connections” since that element does not exist anymore.</p>

<p>We have restored the correct version. I now get connection errors (although for the moment, they are not translated into english yet, it seems):
Errors:

</blockquote>

<p>Great, thanks! I will fix the remaining occurrences in 09 tomorrow.</p>

<p>Regarding the business rule, if we catch all occurrences where a conflict might result while respecting all other rules, it is probably better to leave it unchanged - seeing as people have now worked under this premise for a long time. If anything, we should probably change the evaluator.</p>

      <div class='comment' id='comment_1198'
        <p><p>Hi @LeoB Sorry for the cryptic IDs. There <em>is</em> a service_intention with ID ‘77]877’ and its route has the same ID. That route has a route_section with sequence_number 305 (it’s the last route_section in route_path ‘Standard’), which has a minimum_running_time of 2minutes and 22s, i.e. 142 seconds.</p>

<p>If you searched for “[77]877” you didn’t find it because the opening bracked is missing. You have to search for “77]877”. That is obviously a human-caused typo, but we probably shouldn’t change the files now.</p>

<p>The problem is that your solution seems to spend less than 142 seconds on the train_run_section corresponding to route_section 77]877#305. In fact, it seems to spend 0 second in this section. That would mean the entry_time is probably identical to the exit_time. Could you check that in your solution?</p>

        <p><p>Just wanted to add that we are encouraged by the increasing number of submissions in recent weeks/days. We know this problem is probably not as accessible as many other ‘standard’ AI Challenges. We really appreciate everybody’s effort that tries to make a contribution! Keep up the good work and I hope everybody has some fun along the way, too.</p>

<p>Thanks!

        <p><p>Indeed the problem was that in the solution file model_03_FWA_0.125_result.json you indicated that this solution is intended for problem instance 07_V1.22_FWA (problem_instance_hash -1799980237). What then happens is that our validator service does not find any problem instance with this hash in its memory - hence the “Resource Not Found” Exception.</p>

<p>What you of course meant was that this should be a solution for problem instance 03 with problem_instance_hash 934543999.</p>

<p>If you correct that, your solution validates and has 0 errors and only the standard “wrong hash warning”, which you can ignore. In other words, it is a perfect solution to this problem instance. Well done!</p>

        <p><p>404 means “resource not found”. It would suggest that it cannot find something important. It typically happens when the solution contains an incorrect problem_instance_hash.
However, in this case there seem to be other problems.
Could you send me both the solution you are trying to validate and the corresponding problem instance? Since attachments are not possible here, you can email them as a zip to julian.jordi@sbb.ch</p>

<p>I will follow up tomorrow. Cheers

        <p><p>Hi @Raluca</p>

<p>We have marked the submissions, that just use our sample submission as “BASELINE”. They still appear in the learderboard, but the “actual” leaders are the first submissions that are NOT marked as BASELINE.</p>

<p>An early version of the grader did not penalize invalid solutions correctly. That has since been fixed. I found one submission, that was not penalized properly and deleted it.</p>

<p>From my point of view, everything should be fixed now. The leaderboard should reflect the situation correctly.</p>

<p>If anyone finds any more inconsistencies, please let us know.</p>

<p>Thanks.

        <p><p>@LeoB 
&gt; can I make the assumption that in correct example that the ending_point off one route section is the section_marker of the next route section in sequence?</p>

<p>No, you should not make this assumption. In fact, it’s best if you ignore the fields starting_point and ending_point. We use these for visualising solutions, but not during the solution algorithm.</p>

<p>If what you want to do is find the “next” section(s) to a given section, then within a route_path you could simply take the next section according to the sequence_number. In general, once you have the graph as described in route_graph.py, probably the best way to find “next” (or “previous”) sections would be to ask the networkx library to do that for you.</p>

<p>You may also look at sorting the route graph topologically. In the networkx graph library, you could do that with <a href="https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.dag.topological_sort.html">this</a> function.</p>

<p>Would this solve, what you are trying to do?</p>

        <p><p>Hi @hur . The ‘types’ are not important. They are purely meta-information and only in the data model for internal reasons. It’s best if you don’t even look at them.</p>

<p>The correct way to find out what are start and end sections in the route for a service_intention is to build a graph as described <a href="https://github.com/crowdAI/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge-starter-kit/blob/master/utils/route_graph.ipynb">in the notebook</a>.
Every section starting in a source node of this graph is a possible first section. Every section ending in a sink node is a possible last section.</p>

        <p><p>It is true that there is redundancy in the routes in the input files, i.e. distinct routes can actually be identical. The model would allow distinct service intentions to use the same route, but this can lead to subtle problems. It is much easier and safer to just give each service intention its own route.</p>

<p>The fact that there are redundant routes in the <em>input file</em> does not make the actual <em>problem</em> harder. When modelling the conflicts between trains, you have to associate to each train its own route anyway. It just makes the input file a little larger, but that should not be a noticeable problem. Where do see performance bottlenecks? Do you do a very expensive preprocessing for each route?</p>

        <p><p>You’re absolutely right, it should be a soft constraint. There is a parameter in the problem instances called “maxBandabweichung”, which translates roughly to “maximum allowed delay”. It seems we actually coded this as a hard rule in the grader. Meaning the grader now warns for delays between 0 and the maximum allowed delay, and throws an error for larger delays.</p>

<p>Will look into it. The easiest solution should be to remove this parameter from the instances. But let me test this first. If it works, I will let you know when the updated instances have been uploaded to the repo</p>

<p>There was a bug in the grader, see the post in <a href="../topics/challenge-updates/discussion/index.html">Challenge Updates</a>. That particular submission contained invalid solutions which were not penalized correctly.</p>

<p>The bug has been fixed. The affected participants have been informed and can resubmit their solutions.</p>

<p>We will also remove the sample submissions (those with a score of 30581.917) from the leaderboard, so they don’t clog it up. The platform team is working on a permanent solution for that.</p>

<p>Currently, the best submission produced by a participant is the one from @p0ete with a score of 60001.6</p>

        <p><p>Hi @LeoB Thanks for the submission and sorry for the not-so-helpful error message. In your case, the problem is that you submitted the solution for the 01<em>dummy instance directly. However, the grader expects a _list</em> containing the individual solutions. Just wrap the JSON of your solution into square brackets […] and it should validate. You should then get at least the numeric score for the submission.</p>

<p>We are working on an improved grader that will provide better feedback, in particual in case of errors. It should be deployed early next week. We are also looking for ways to include the detailed validation feedback, so you can access it via the Submissions page.</p>

<p>We will post updates when these improvements are deployed. In the meantime, yes, we advise to use the REST-API to get detailed feedback on business-rule-compliance of an individual solution.</p>

        <p><p>Hi all</p>

<p>We’re seeing some activity in our grader that people use the <a href="https://github.com/crowdAI/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge-starter-kit/blob/master/utils/validate_solution.py">REST-API</a> to validate individual solutions. That’s great!</p>

<p>Remember: Just shoot us a message if you find it hard to interpret what exactly is wrong with your solution. We’ll be happy to assist. It is also possible that some German text is not caught in our very basic translation script and is then displayed at your end. In this case, please also notify us so we can extend the translation.</p>

<p>Thanks and keep up the great work!</p>

  <p>Hi @Raphael. Not sure if I understand things properly here.
If you want an AI approach, much much more data is needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hi @Çalexàdésirer We are open to any kind of approach to the problem. It does not need to be an AI approach.</p>

<p>As Mohanty pointed out, you can find references to all available resources in the <a href="sign_in.html">Dataset</a> section.</p>

        <p><p>Hi @lvb</p>

<p>Great question, I can understand your confusion!</p>

<p>Thing is, we use the fields <em>starting_point</em> and <em>ending_point</em> internally basically as geographical reference markers when plotting the timetable in graphical form, something like <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildfahrplan#/media/File:Train_graph_Riesbahn_2005.svg">this</a>. Having the same starting and end point then means that the train spends some time there, but doesn’t actually proceed to the next geographical point. Of course, this typically means it has a stop there.</p>

<p>In <em>calculating</em> the timetable, we never actually use the starting_point and ending_point, it is only afterwards for visualisation.</p>

<p>Now, to actually answer your questions. If you look at route_graph.py, it also doesn’t use starting_poing and ending_point, but rather it uses either the <em>sequence_numbers</em> of the sections (which, by some axiom, we promise to be unique in a route), or the <em>route_alternative_marker</em> if there is one route coming together in a node.</p>

<p>As an example, I copied below the output of the route_graph script which lists the node labels it assigns to the nodes for the sample scenario (see the <a href="https://github.com/crowdAI/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge-starter-kit/blob/master/utils/route_graph.md#example">notebook</a>).</p>

<p>You will notice, they are either built up with sequence_numbers or with route_alternative_markers. The starting_point and end_point are not used. The _end and _start suffixes, by the way, are used when a node does not have incoming or outgoing arcs, so we know it is a source or a sink node just from the label.</p>

<p>Constructing route graph for route 111</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Adding Edge from (1_beginning) to (M1) with sequence number 1</code> -&gt; add arc 1. The starting node doesn’t have an incoming arc, so give it the name of the section plus the suffix _beginning. The end node receives the label of the route_alternative_marker</p>

<p>Adding Edge from (M1) to (4-&gt;5) with sequence number 4 -&gt; second arc. It starts at M1 and its end node receives the label 4-&gt;5, which means its (unique) incoming arc has sequence number 4 and its (unique) outgoing arc has sequence number 5.
Note that if there was more than one incoming or outoing arc, then we would label the node according to its route_alternative_marker as above.</p>

<p>…and so on…</p>

<p>I hope this clears things up a bit?</p>

<p>Thanks again for the great question!</p>
